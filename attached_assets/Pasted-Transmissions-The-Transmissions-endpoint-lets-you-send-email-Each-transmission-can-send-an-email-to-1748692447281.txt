Transmissions
The Transmissions endpoint lets you send email. Each transmission can send an email to a single recipient or thousands. Reach Email API generates and sends messages using the options you've defined, a list of recipients, and the content given in transmissions call.
When creating a transmission, the options allow you to configure engagement tracking, sending optimization, global substitution data, and more to control how your emails are sent.
To set the recipients you can include all recipients in the request or use a stored recipient list. For each recipient, you can specify metadata and substitution data to personalize each email. You can also set the transmission to treat certain recipients as CC'd or BCC'd.
The content of the messages can be set in 4 different ways: inline content, a stored template, an A/B test, or raw RFC822 content. Each method is best suited for different use cases. All of these types of content can use the substitution data and metadata to create a unique message for each recipient.
